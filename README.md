[![CI](https://github.com/andschneider/mlbt/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/andschneider/mlbt/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A terminal user interface for the MLB Statcast API, written in Rust.

Check scores, standings, and stats. Even watch a live game using Gameday!

## What

The MLB Statcast API is a publicly available (see its [license](#license)
information below) REST API that you can query to get back almost any
information about a baseball game, past or present. If you've ever watched a
baseball game on TV you've seen the data the API passes around in action. Two
prime examples are the pitch/strike zone overlay, and home run stats (like
distance and launch angle). This is accomplished by MLB's sophisticated Statcast
vision system, which is implemented in every Major League ballpark.

This TUI is an interface for the API, with the intention of providing a light
weight way to consume baseball data. See the [features](#features) listed below
for more details.

A TUI and baseball data make a pretty natural combination, at least compared to
other sports. The Gameday view allows you to "watch" a live game by polling the
API every 10 seconds. This matches the poll rate at which the official Gameday,
found [here](https://www.mlb.com/scores), operates at. The goal with the TUI
version is to mimic the official version as closely as possible.

## Shout out

This is built with the wonderful [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs).

These TUIs were extremely helpful:
[spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui),
[tickrs](https://github.com/tarkah/tickrs),
[bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom).

A reference MLB stats API client by
[toddrob99](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) helped make up for the
lack of API documentation.
